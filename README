BandiJ - Relational algebra for Java

BandiJ is the data transformation engine for Java programming language based on
the relational model. Exactly the same approach is used by relational databases,
though due to the high complexity of the most RDBMS it widely adopted, and also
it is very frequently misinterpreted. This project is an attempt to bring the
key ideas used in the relational databases into the Java world, yet keeping it
as simple & fast as possible.

Note that this engine works solely within the JVM and does not require any
libraries apart from the standard JSE runtime.

Here is all you need to know to manipulate your data:
    * there is only one data abstraction - relation (similar to a table)
    * there are several relational operators, e.g. select, join, etc.
