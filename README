BandiJ - Relational algebra for Java

BandiJ is the data transformation engine for Java programming language based
on the relational model. Exactly the same approach is utilised by relational
databases to provide the data independence (an ability to keep your data
separate from the way you use it). This project is an attempt to bring the
key ideas used in the relational databases into the Java world, keeping it as
simple as possible.

Note that this engine works solely within the JVM and does not require any
libraries apart from the standard JSE runtime.

Here is all you need to know to manipulate your data:
    * there is only one data abstraction - relation (similar to a table)
    * there are several relational operators, e.g. select, join, etc.
