BandiJ - Relational algebra for Java

Copyright 2011 Ostap Cherkashin

This project is an attempt to bring the key ideas used in the relational
databases into the Java world, keeping it as simple & fast as possible.

Many thanks to Cezar Lotrean, who introduced me to the code which really
required (IMO) this approach, and for productive discussions about the
interfaces and general principles of the system. All this have helped me
to finally sit down and start working on it :-)
